# Standalone page

**You don't need React to write simple standalone pages!** You can create standalone pages with markdown and place them in the `/pages` directory. [Learn more](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page).

---

## Examples and usage

### Paragraph

Docusaurus lets you focus on your docs, and we'll do the chores. Go ahead and move your docs into the `/docs` directory. Notice how the use of markdown headings creates an intended table of contents list in the sidebar!

### Text decoration

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or `keyword`.

### Hyperlinks

You can even [link](/) to another page.

### Syntax highlighting

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true
}
```

```css
/* CSS code with syntax highlighting. */
.hero {
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 4rem 0;
  position: relative;
  text-align: center;
}
```

```text
Super long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
